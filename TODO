Would be good to check correctness of the Pdot(t) terms, as they seem to behave strangely at small times (there's a large oscillation about 0), even though this does not seem to detrimentally impact the level populations.

Need to strip out remaining, unnecessary LIME parameters and source code files. Probably a good idea to remove all references to LIME, since so much of the code has now changed.

Move some key parameters from the code to the lime.h file, such as the optical depth cutoffs for EP method, number of supersamples during raytracting, etc.

Make the input file more user-friendly, and rewrite the code so that it does not have to be compiled every time at runtime.

Update CVODE calls to work with CVODE 6 (or whatever the latest version is) by adding SUNContext = SUNContext_Create() call, and passing the SUNContext as the last argument to CVODE (see https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/release-history).
